## Infinite recursive shape
As part of the this [test](https://infinite-peaceful-stream.herokuapp.com/). I have setup this project.  

The big 0 for the algorithm to draw the shape is O(n^2).

### Start the project 

1. Clone the repo
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start`
1. Visit `http://localhost:8080`, you will see a box with width 20, height 20 and padding 4  
    20 width, 20 height, 4 padding are the default values, You can change and submit the form to see new results.

### Development

`npm run dev` starts a development server and uses nodemon for project refresh

### Run Tests

`npm run test`

### Github action setup

I have setup the project to test and deploy to [cloud run](https://cloud.google.com/run) on push to the master branch. Project deploys [here](https://infinite-shape-zt3jafnsma-uc.a.run.app/)
